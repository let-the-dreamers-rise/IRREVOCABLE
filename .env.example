# IRREVOCABLE - Azure OpenAI Configuration
# =========================================
# This application is designed for Azure OpenAI Service.
# Set these environment variables to enable live AI inference.
# If not set, the application will use a deterministic fallback generator.

# Your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint
# Example: https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/

# Your Azure OpenAI API key
# Get this from Azure Portal > Your OpenAI Resource > Keys and Endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# The deployment name for your model
# This is the name you gave when deploying the model in Azure OpenAI Studio
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=irrevocable-reflection-generator

# Notes:
# - Live inference may be region-gated on student/restricted Azure subscriptions
# - The fallback generator provides stable demo functionality without Azure
# - Switching to live Azure OpenAI requires no code changes, only these env vars
